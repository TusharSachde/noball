                Custom Cricket Company (CCC) is the only known firm to wholly customise your cricketing gear ranging from playing apparel to gloves, pads, kit bags and even your own ball. It's inception comes from a childhood dream of having a cricket team kitted up in their very own brand and now extending this experience to the world. After many years passionately pursuing the sport at a recreational level, Digvijay (or Diggy) has started CCC with his wife Swati and cousin Imran. The team has grown rapidly across segments but operations and strategy remain within the trio allowing CCC clients to have the personal touch.
