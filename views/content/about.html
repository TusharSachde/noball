      <p>Custom Cricket Company (CCC) is the only known firm to wholly customise your cricketing gear ranging from playing apparel to gloves, pads, kit bags and even your own ball. </p>
      <p>It's inception comes from a childhood dream of having a cricket team kitted up in their very own brand and now extending this experience to the world. After many years passionately pursuing the sport at a recreational level, Digvijay (or Diggy) has started CCC with his wife Swati and cousin Imran. The team has grown rapidly across segments but operations and strategy remain within the trio allowing CCC clients to have the personal touch.</p>
      <p>CCC has thus chosen to work with only the best factories in north India which produce over 80% of the world's cricket equipment. Apparel designs and tailoring are still closer to home where craftsmanship is a daily process in Mumbai as an extension to an age-old family business.</p>
      <p>All CCC profits go towards infrastructure development for sports in rural India - Kathiwada, Madhya Pradesh. All CCC prices come to you directly from the factory floor and are VAT free (for all exports of sports goods from our special economic zones).</p>
      <p>At CCC we are committed to the full consumer experience by crafting for you a uniquely customised product. It's your brand and we'll bring it to life.</p>
